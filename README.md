# Core C Skills

This repository documents my journey to master the fundamentals of the C programming language.
  
The goal is to build a strong, low-level foundation for systems programming.

## Concepts Practiced
- Linked Lists
- Memory Management (`malloc`, `free`, `valgrind`)
- Data Structures
- Algorithms

## Projects
- **Linked List Basics**: Creation, traversal, and manipulation of singly linked lists.

## About this Repository

‚ö°Ô∏è Unlike a finished project, this repo is meant to show my **learning process**.  

Each commit represents a step in my progression:

- Starting with basic node creation.
- Adding functions like `add_to_start` and `add_to_end`.
- Moving into operations such as `swap_first_two` and `push_to_list`.

### How to Explore the Journey
You can use Git to navigate through the stages of my learning:

```bash
git log --oneline        # see the history of my progress
git show <commit_hash>   # inspect a specific step
git diff <id1> <id2>     # compare between stages
```

## Example: From Basic to Advanced

This example shows how the repository evolved step by step, from the initial commit to more advanced linked list operations:

- [56fca52](https://github.com/fvilpaz/c_core_skills/commit/56fca52) **BUILD**: Initial commit. Adding linked list practice code.  
- [4314295](https://github.com/fvilpaz/c_core_skills/commit/4314295) **DOCS**: Add README with goals and concepts.  
- [adcb3cf](https://github.com/fvilpaz/c_core_skills/commit/adcb3cf) **DIA 2**: add_to_end implementado. Listas operativas.  
- [ff28c94](https://github.com/fvilpaz/c_core_skills/commit/ff28c94) **FEAT**: add print_list and free_list functions.  
- [fdc4ce0](https://github.com/fvilpaz/c_core_skills/commit/fdc4ce0) **FEAT**: add add_to_start & swap_first_two functions.

## Notes

üìù This repo is public to share my practice and learning journey.  
The actual 42 project (**push_swap**) is kept in a private repository as per school rules.
